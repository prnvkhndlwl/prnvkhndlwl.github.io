					<h2>Field season 2017</h2>
					<p>~3 months in the Agumbe rainforest collecting gliding data on flying lizards. Majority of the
						funding was raised
						from a <a
							href="https://experiment.com/projects/how-the-dragon-glides-the-biomechanics-of-a-flying-lizard"
							target="_blank"><i>crowdfunding campaign</i></a>. This field season took ~2 years
						of preparation from raising funds, finalizing all the equipment, testing, getting
						permissions...to hiring an
						awesome field assistant (shoutout to Steve Rodgie) and finalizing the travel and field site
						reservations. </p>
				</header>
				<p>The goal of the field season was to collect high quality behavioral and kinematic data of 
					these fascinating lizards in the wild with the goal to understand the aerodynamics of gliding, and 
					how different natural behaviors like foraging, mate-seeking, territoriality manifest in their glide
					biomechanics. Furthermore, this also allowed to gain insights into sex-specific differences in 
					their glide performance.
				</p>

					<h3>flying lizard in the wild</h3>
				</header>
				<p>During the mating season, flying lizards are extremely active, allowing for some action
					packed glides and maneuvers. Below are a few images of the lizard in action along with 
					some non-gliding shots.

						<h3>marking trees</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Quantifying the territorial behavior (males defend territories to gain sole access to food and females)
						required recording the distribution of individuals throughout the field site. We marked all 912 trees on
						our field site with unique alphabet and number combination to keep a track of the lizard population
						distribution.

						<h3>catching flying lizards</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Identifying individuals was important to track the lizard distribution and
						also collect morphometric measurements for biomechanical analysis. Catching an
						individual was a team effort. Use binoculars to spot an individual high-up in
						the trees. We used a neat contraption (shoutout to Shankar C.M.) which allowed
						easy capture of the lizard without hurting them. Using tripod poles and a metal tong, 
						Shankar was able to make a long pole (6m) with a horseshoe shaped wire attached to the tong at 
						one end which was wrapped with a thick soft padding and cloth hanging from it. A string connected 
						to the horseshoe shaped wire hung at the other end. When pulled, the string would close 
						the horseshoe, wrapping it around the tree trunk; this would force the lizard to climb 
						downwards, and right into our waiting palms! The bottom animation shows Steve and I using the 
						contraption make by Shankar to catch the lizard. (video credits:

						<h3>marking and measuring</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Once the lizards were caught, Steve and I used an electronic weighing scale to measure their weight and clicked images of the lizard
						against a graph sheet (left image). These images could be used later to extract various morphometric measurements of the animal. Finally, each 
						individual was given a unique id by painting a number on its dorsal side (right image). This allowed for easy identification of the individual
						in the jungle and ensured that we recorded data from as many different individuals as possible.

						<h3>MOCAP in the jungle</h3>
					</header>
					<p>To collect high resolution 3D kinematic, body pose and orientation data, we constructed a motion capture arena in the jungle. Below is 
						an overhead drone shot of the jungle and the motion capture arena (constructed using white sheets for high contrast during motion tracking). </p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/flight_arena_zoom.gif" alt="" /></span>
					<header>
						<h3>setting up the MOCAP arena</h3>
					</header>
					<p>We set up seven GoPro cameras to record the lizard gliding from the takeoff tree on the right to the landing tree on the left. Two cameras were 
						mounted on and next to the takeoff tree, followed by the four cameras on the ground and one camera on the landing tree.
					</p>
